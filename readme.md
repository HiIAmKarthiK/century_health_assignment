we just have to install the setups mentioned in requiremnts.txt have pyspark, docker installed locally.

running:
docker compose up airflow-init 
docker-compose up -d

should run the whole app, along with piechart and results.

This would take care of creating DB and tables automatically for first run

Thanks.
